AI-powered MRI scan analysis using YOLOv6 &amp; PyTorch for brain disease detection.

# ðŸ§  Brain Disease Prediction

An AI-powered deep learning project that detects brain diseases from MRI scans using **YOLOv6** and **PyTorch**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Detects and classifies brain diseases from MRI scans
- Preprocessing with **OpenCV** & **NumPy**
- Achieved **92% accuracy** with reduced false positives by 35%
- Flask web app for real-time predictions
- Trained on 10,000+ MRI images

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **YOLOv6**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Flask**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
